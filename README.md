# What is CS61A about?
In the tradition of SICP, CS61A focuses on methods for abstraction, programming paradigms, and techniques for managing the complexity of large programs. These concepts are illustrated primarily using the Python 3 programming language.
According to the lecturer, CS61A is:
1. A course about managing complexity, mastering abstraction, programming paradigms;
2. An introduction to programming, full understanding of Python fundamentals, combining multiple ideas in large projects, how computers interpret programming languages.

# Workload
CS61A is my first programming course ever. Even I skip the scheme and SQL part, it still took me about a month to finish most of the homework, labs and projects. I have to say this is the best introductory course for a beginner. Even you have accumulated some experience in programming, you will also feel inspired by the lecture.
I upload three projects that I have completed. The best one is Ants v.s Some Bees, which puts all knowledge you have learned in this course together. You can check the guides and framework provided on CS61A official website.
